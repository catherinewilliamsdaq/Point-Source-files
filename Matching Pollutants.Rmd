## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#read in process emissions and webfire table
PE2020 <- read_csv("2020 process emissions.csv")
webfire <- read_csv("WebFIRE_for_UDAQ_SLEIS.csv")

#select columns and filter out NAs in webfire table
PE2020s <- PE2020 %>% select(`Facility Identifier`:`Facility Name`, `Emission Unit Identifier`,`Process Identifier`,`SCC`,`Pollutant: Description`)
webfires <- webfire %>% select(`WebFIRE SCC`, `POLLUTANT`) %>% filter(`WebFIRE SCC` != is.na(`WebFIRE SCC`))

#filter for unique pollutants (only one of each pollutant per SCC) and rename columns to match PE2020s
webfireselect <- webfires %>% distinct()  %>% rename(`SCC` = `WebFIRE SCC`, `Pollutant: Description` = `POLLUTANT`)

#convert SCC column from double to character
webfireselect$`SCC` <- as.character(webfireselect$`SCC`)

#left_join PE2020s and webfireselect
# problem: ultimately want seven columns, including one SCC and two pollutant description columns. The line below gives the same pollutant x for each different pollutant y. How to get the distinct but matching pollutant x and y, while also including any NAs from y? Do the values/pollutant names need to be changed in PE2020s to match webfireselect names?
matchpollutants <- left_join(PE2020s, webfireselect, by = "SCC", "Pollutant: Description") #%>% filter(`Pollutant: Description.x` == `Pollutant: Description.y`)
```
