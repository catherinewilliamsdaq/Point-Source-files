## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#This chunk identifies processes where throughput is reported, but not any hours.
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
#Read in process emissions file
PE2020 <- read_csv("2020 process emissions.csv")
#Select columns in PE2020, filtered out 0 thoughput and 0 actual hours
opscomp <- PE2020 %>% select(`Facility Identifier`:`Facility Name`, `Emission Unit Identifier`:`SCC`, `Throughput`:`Throughput Unit of Measure: Description`, `Standard Start Time`:`Dec Operations (%)`) %>% filter(`Throughput` != "0" & `Actual Hours` == "0")
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
#This chunk identifies processes where the actual hours are greater than the difference between the start and stop times
opscompday <- PE2020 %>% select(`Facility Identifier`:`Facility Name`, `Emission Unit Identifier`:`SCC`, `Throughput`:`Throughput Unit of Measure: Description`, `Standard Start Time`:`Dec Operations (%)`) %>% mutate(ops_hours = (`Standard Stop Time` - `Standard Start Time`)) 
#Stopped here to discuss with Lexie any issues with having negative ops_hours
```
```{r}
#This chunk identifies facilties that report any 0% in the monthly operations and also report 52 weeks per year.
#selected columns, filtered where any monthly percentage column = 0
